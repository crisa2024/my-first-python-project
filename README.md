# Financial Calculator (Python)
This Python program acts as a simple financial calculator, that offers the user two options to choose from:

* Investment Calculator: Calculates the interest that will be earned on the investment and the future value of the investment based on the interest rate, type of interest and the investment period. 
* Home Loan Repayment Calculator: Calculates the monthly payment required in order for the user to repay the loan over the specified period, given the interest rate and the specific term after the user  wants to repay the loan. 

## Usage
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Run the program in your terminal by using python financial_calculator.py . 
3. The program will prompt you to choose between the Investment Calculator (choice '1') or the Home Loan Repayment Calculator (choice '2').
4. Follow the instructions displayed on the screen and enter the required information after making your choice.
5. The program will display the amount of interest you'll earn on your investment along with the future investment value or the monthly loan payment required.

## Features:
**Two financial calculators in one program (the Investment Calculator and the Home Loan Repayment calculator).**
* **Clear Navigation**: User-friendly interface with prompts and instructions.

* **Error Handling**: Basic input validation for user entries in order to ensure users enter valid data for calculations.

* **Multi-use Functionality**: Both calculators can be used repeatedly within a program session as long as you choose not to end the program. This means that you do not need to restart the program to perform calculations again. 


**Disclaimer:** This program provides a simplified financial calculator. It aims to give the user a general idea of investment returns or home loan repayments but it does not account for all real-world factors.
